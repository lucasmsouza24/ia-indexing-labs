# Raw Data

This folder contains the original, unmodified datasets used for experiments and analysis.

The raw data is **not stored in the repository** due to file size constraints.
To use the project, download the dataset manually from Kaggle:

- [Steam Players Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michau96/popularity-of-games-on-steam)

Once downloaded, place the CSV file in this folder with the name:
`steam_player_counts.csv`
